    "# SQL Interview Questions  - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Text,Integer,Real,Blob\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "A Primary Key is a unique identifier for a table. A Foreign Key is an identifier that is unique to a table that is being joined with another-it *is* unique to table B, but table A has multiple instances of specific values.\n",
    "Like: table A is employees, table B is offices, all employees have data on what office they work in. Employee Number is the primary key for A, office code is primary key for B. If joined, then office code is considered a foreign key for A.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "- Inner, default: only includes row if the data exists in BOTH A and B\n",
    "- Left: includes all rows in table A, includes data from B that exists in A (A that is NOT in B has null values)\n",
    "- Right: A and B reversed from Left Join (not in sqlite3)\n",
    "- Outer: all rows in A and B included, null values if missing from either\n",
    "- can also specifically *exclude* the combined (Inner Join) section, by searching for only null values\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "Group By joins multiple rows with a primary identifier - the data that shares this identifier is aggregated, such functions might count the number of rows aggregated for each ID, or sum or average numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "They keep track of the associations between the joining IDs between joined tables\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we practiced answering open-ended interview questions for SQL and Relational Databases. "
